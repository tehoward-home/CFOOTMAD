                        Contra dancing is social, community dancing where everyone is welcome. It's easy to learn, 
                        everything is taught, and no dance experience is necessary. There's no need to bring a partner 
                        (we typically change partners for each dance of the evening), and all our events feature great 
                        live music. Most include a free lesson which is all you'll need for the evening. You can make 
                        new friends and have fun in a friendly welcoming crowd. Contra dancing is highly energetic and aerobic.
